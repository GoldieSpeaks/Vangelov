                                    <p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: #b8b8b8;">This project aimed to rework the existing Company payment links/web solutions with an up-to-date design and user experience that created delight and ease of use for millions of users across the globe. Previously, the design language, user experience and overall structure of the links which the company provided for each client was really bad and was full of clutter, creating confusion and was a nightmare to navigate in general.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">With this project we followed trends and best use practices to ensure that the Company links/web solutions are up to speed and on par with competitors in terms of user experience and design.</p>

                            <p class="sub-heading">Challenge Overview</p>
                            <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">The main challenge that we were facing was finding the best approach with the least amount of effort, risk impact, and time investment. The company had 1,840 live payment links at the time of the project, each with unique customizations accumulated over years of client requests. This created a complex, interdependent system where any global change could have unintended repercussions.</p>

                                <div style="padding-right: 30px;" class="left-col">

                                        <b class="sub-heading2">Conflicting Customizations:</b>
                                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">All major changes to the payment links were hard to execute, as numerous customizations had been added to different client links over the years. Global changes had the potential to impact each client's link differently.</p>
                                     </div>
                                     <div>
                                        <b class="sub-heading2">Complex System Logic:</b>
                                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Altering the core logic meant navigating accumulated conditional logic layers. Any modification risked unexpected repercussions in other functionalities, making updates riskier and more time-consuming.</p>
                                     </div>
                                     <div>

                                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Ensuring high quality required extensive testing across 1,840+ links due to complex customizations and interdependencies. Every change required careful analysis and regression testing.</p>

                                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">UI/UX developers and engineers had to work closely to bring maximum impact with least resistance. Each UI change touched logic that could create issues across different client implementations.</p>
                                     </div>
                                     <div>
                                        <b class="sub-heading2">Client Approval Management:</b>
                                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Updates required careful approval processes since clients had different requirements and dependencies. A structured approval pipeline was essential to ensure stakeholder involvement before deployment.</p>
                                     </div>
                                     <div>
                                        <b class="sub-heading2">Outdated Design Language:</b>
                                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">The existing design lacked cohesive visual identity with inconsistent fonts, colors, and UI components. A unified design system was needed to ensure brand consistency and polish.</p>

                            <b class="sub-heading2">Strategy Overview</b>
                            <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Before beginning development, we needed to ensure our solution proposition was backed by analytics and statistics. We took a data-driven approach leveraging heat maps, user statistics, and competitor analysis to identify key improvement areas and design a balanced, intuitive design language.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="section">
                                <b class="sub-heading2">Phase One - Planning & Research</b>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;"><b>Step One: Taking in Metrics</b> - Through customer support teams and employed surveys, we gathered quantitative and detailed user feedback. We implemented feedback forms presented to users just before completing their payment process, and our support team actively collected insights during interactions.</p>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;"><b>Step Two: User Feedback</b> - We reviewed heat maps to understand how users interacted with the product, and made a thorough statistical analysis using Google Analytics. This identified key elements creating clutter and confusion, as well as elements most focused on.</p>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;"><b>Step Three: Competitor Analysis</b> - We conducted thorough competitor analysis reviewing similar platforms to identify best practices, usability patterns, and opportunities for differentiation in layout design, user flows, feature sets, and overall engagement.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="section">
                                <b class="sub-heading2">Phase Two - Design & Development</b>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">From our research, we distilled the three most important factors and created a balanced and intuitive design language. We created low and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, establishing a unified design system with consistent fonts, colors, and UI components. Key focus areas included: <b>Clarity & Focus</b> (visual hierarchy), <b>Optimized User Flow</b> (intuitive navigation), and <b>Usability</b> (user engagement).</p>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Development required careful coordination between UI/UX designers and engineers to navigate the accumulated conditional logic and ensure changes didn't create issues across different client customizations. We addressed style guide misalignments and inconsistent UI elements throughout.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="section">
                                <b class="sub-heading2">Phase Three - Testing & Optimization</b>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">At development kickoff, we established tight alignment between QA and development teams. The QA team used automation testing to check how redesigned pages handled across the 1,840+ live payment links. All redesigned pages went through both manual testing (features) and automation testing (link compatibility).</p>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">We adopted the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to prioritize testing efforts on the most frequently used and business-critical portals, ensuring maximum impact with available resources. Corner case lists were created for clients with customizations, and extensive regression testing verified no unintended bugs or inconsistencies.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="section">
                                <b class="sub-heading2">Phase Four - Deployment & Results</b>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">As we were unable to map out all exceptions and customizations completely, we requested feedback directly from clients. We sent a global review request to all clients to test their platforms after go-live and flag any issues.</p>
                                <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">The redesigned payment portal was successfully deployed across 1,840+ active links. The unified design system addressed previous pain points: scattered user attention became clear focus, misleading user journeys became optimized flows, inconsistent UI elements became harmonized design language, and inconsistent performance across devices was resolved through responsive design.</p>
