                <h2>Project Overview </h2>
                <p>The Data Deletion Initiative is a bi-annual project designed to identify and remove sensitive personal data that has remained untouched for over 10 years. This proactive measure ensures the protection of user privacy and complies with industry-standard regulations, which mandate the deletion of outdated data across all companies and large organisations handling user information.    </p>
                <p>The goal of this project was to precisely align with these regulatory requirements by identifying eligible user data and securely erasing it to safeguard privacy and maintain compliance.</p>

            <p>Addressing these challenges required a structured, methodical approach, robust tools, and a clear understanding of both technical and regulatory constraints. Also, not to mention that we were working with a Legacy system and a somewhat poorly organized database.</p>

                        <h3>Time for Execution</h3>
                        <p>At first glance, data deletion may seem straightforward, especially when considered from a high-level perspective. However, upon closer inspection, the process involves a multitude of complexities, particularly when dealing with legacy systems that were not originally designed with modern privacy standards, like GDPR, in mind. These systems often accumulate years of sensitive user information from a variety of sources, creating layers of interconnected data that must be carefully identified, mapped, and managed before deletion can occur.</p>
                        <p>One of the primary challenges in this process is that sensitive data isn't always stored in easily identifiable locations. User data can be spread across multiple channels, integrated into various parts of the database, or intertwined with other non-sensitive information, making its identification more complex. Moreover, evolving privacy regulations and compliance requirements impose additional constraints, increasing the pressure to ensure that all necessary data is correctly pinpointed and erased.</p>
                        <p>Our approach addresses these complexities head-on, breaking the process down into three primary phases that simplify execution. Each step requires careful planning and specialized algorithms to ensure precision. Even though these steps may initially seem straightforward, they demand a deep understanding of both the database architecture and the applicable regulatory frameworks. This ensures not only successful data deletion but also minimizes the risk of accidental data loss or incomplete deletion, both of which could lead to non-compliance or future complications.</p>

                <p>This ment that we had to take in all types onto account and had to be sure what data fell into the domain of GDPR regulations, not to mention reviewing the exceptions that were made for customers, which took in sensitive data that fell outside of the general database tables. </p>

                        <p>Being a large project, TransferMate Education has not one product that needed to be taken into account when it comes to data collection, storage and processing. At this stage, we started creating high level diagrams based on roles and data collection channels.</p>
                        <p>All aspects of the project and products had to be taken in account, and even though the chart shown here shows just some of the branches, having to go through each nuke and cranny of the education project took us effort and good charting skills. </p>
                        <p>At this stage we had to chart a map that would enable us to later on navigate the database with ease, given the higher level understanding of the data structure, we were able to understand the legacy database structure more accurately and outline all the relations that had to be taken in account.</p>
