                            <p>This project aimed to re-work the existing TransferMate Education [Links / Web Solution] with an up to date design and user experience that creates delight and ease of use for the millions of users across the globe. Previously, the design language, user experience and overall structure of the links which TM provvided for each client was really bad and was full of clutter, which created confusion and was rough to navigate in general. </p>
                            <p>With this project we followed trends and best use practices to ensure that the TM Education [Links / Web Solution] are up to speed and on par with competitors in terms of user experience and design. </p>

                            <div style="padding-bottom: 30px;" class="main-heading-2">What was the Challenge?</div>
                            <div class="heading-sub-2">The main challenge that we were facing was to find the best approach with the least amount of effort, risk impact, and time investment. </div>
                            <p>Transfermate’s business model is not one of the greates to say so, unfortunately the business model was not something which I had ideated in general. TM offers clients API’s and also standalone web based solutions, or in other words standalone websites that can be used to facilitate payments by end users. </p>
                            <p>Having such an offering means that with a ever growing client base within the thousands, managing these standalone web solutions becomes a nightmare.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div style="padding-top: 50px;" class="twocol-text">

                                    <b class="sub-heading2">Conflicting Customizations:</b>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">All major changes to the payments links were hard to execute, as throughout the years numerous customizations had been added to different client links as per client request, meaning that global changes had the potential to impact each clients link differently and create bugs.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;"> These customizations had now reached a point of volume that  made things hard in terms of developing unified solutions.</p>
                                 </div>
                                 <div>
                                    <b class="sub-heading2">Unified Development Approach </b>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">One of the hardest aspects of this project was to find a unified approach for both UI/UX perspective and development perspective. Making any changes to the existing UI or reworking elements on the websites was hard to do, as each change touched on logic that if changed, had the potential to create many issues with different clients and parts of the websites. </p>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">This all meant that UI/UX Developers and Engineers had to work really closely to bring the maximum impact with least resistance to the table. </p>
                                </div>

                                    <b class="sub-heading2">Quality Assurance </b>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Ensuring a high level of quality was a major challenge due to the complexity of customizations and interdependencies within the system. Every change required extensive testing to verify that it did not introduce unexpected bugs or inconsistencies across different client implementations.  Given the intricate nature of the logic and UI components, a robust testing process was necessary, including regression testing, automation, and continuous feedback loops from developers and testers. The goal was to minimize risks while maintaining a stable and scalable system.</p>

                                    <b class="sub-heading2">Making Changes to the Logic</b>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Altering the core logic of the system would be complex, as over the years various layers of conditional logic had been built up to accommodate different client needs and edge cases. This accumulation of logic meant that any change in one part could have unexpected repercussions in another, making updates riskier and more time-consuming.</p>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">At this point, the logic had become so intricate that any modification required careful analysis to ensure it didn't disrupt other functionalities or introduce new bugs.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Altering the core logic of the system would be complex, as over the years various layers of conditional logic had been built up to accommodate different client needs and edge cases. This accumulation of logic meant that any change in one part could have unexpected repercussions in another, making updates riskier and more time-consuming.</p>

                                    <b class="sub-heading2">Client Approvals</b>
                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Since the system was heavily customized for individual clients, any updates or modifications required careful approval processes. Clients had different requirements and dependencies, meaning that even minor changes could impact their workflows.  A structured approval pipeline was essential, ensuring that stakeholders were involved in reviewing and testing updates before deployment. Balancing innovation with stability required clear communication and phased rollouts to minimize disruptions.</p>
                                 </div>
                            </div>

                        <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">In terms of Quality Assurance, a generalized approach was deployed where we used the pareto principle to make testing a bit more easy going and also, we created corner case lists for clients with customizations. Automations for QA testing were also developed to automate high amount of test cases.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Due to a large number of unorganized elements throughout the pages, user attention was being directed towards non-important areas of the websites rather than key ones, thus creating an overall bad user Experience.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">One other point is that our current design language is outdated and is not covering some fundamental principles and rules that should be incorporated in any new web-based design development. </p>

                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">The old design lacked a cohesive visual identity, with inconsistent fonts, colors, and UI components across different sections. This inconsistency caused confusion and reduced trust in the platform. A unified design system was needed to ensure brand consistency and a polished user experience.</p>

                                    <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">The outdated design was not optimized for various screen sizes and devices, this led to inconsistent performance, particularly on mobile and tablet platforms.

                            <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Prior to going about and looking for a solution, we wanted to make sure our solution proposition was backed by analytics and statistics. The first step we took was looking at heat maps in order to understand how our users interacted with our product. A review of statistical data was also made using google analytics</p>
                            <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">Based on the results, we identified key elements that were creating clutter confusion and a problematic user expetience and also key elements that were most focused on. </p>
                            <p style="color: #b8b8b8;">From our research, we distilled the three most important factors and used them to create a balanced and intuitive design language.</p>
