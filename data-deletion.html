                                    <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The Data Deletion Initiative is a bi-annual project designed to identify and remove sensitive personal data that has remained untouched for over 10 years. This proactive measure ensures the protection of user privacy and complies with industry-standard regulations, which mandate the deletion of outdated data across all companies and large organisations handling user information.</p>
                                    <p> The goal of this project was to precisely align with these regulatory requirements by identifying eligible user data and securely erasing it to safeguard privacy and maintain compliance.</p>

                                <p>Addressing these challenges required a structured, methodical approach, robust tools, and a clear understanding of both technical and regulatory constraints.

                                    <p><b>Additionally,</b> we had to stand trial and back our work in front of auditors, proving how all compliance perspectives were covered, thought factual evidence. </p>

                                        <p>Throughout the years a lot of clutter had accumulated within the database, as strict sanitary  principles had not been followed, which made navigation a bit challenging. </p>

                                    <p>At first glance, data deletion may seem straightforward. However, working with a legacy database and managing the numerous channels through which sensitive user data is collected adds significant complexity.</p>
                                    <p>Our overall approach is clear and can be broken down into three primary steps. While these steps may appear simple initially, they have proven to be incredibly challenging to execute in practice.</p>
                                    <p>To address these challenges, our approach integrates automation, robust validation mechanisms, and iterative testing to ensure accuracy and compliance. By continuously refining our processes, we minimize risks associated with data retention while optimizing efficiency. This ensures that data deletion is not only effective but also aligns with evolving regulatory requirements and business needs.</p>
