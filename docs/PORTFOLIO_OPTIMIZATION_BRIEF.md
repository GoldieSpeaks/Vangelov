# Portfolio Optimization Brief
## Zlatomir Vangelov - Product Owner, Entrepreneur & UI/UX Designer

**Document Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Objective:** Transform portfolio into a job-winning showcase that captivates recruiters and hiring managers  
**Target Audience:** Tech companies, fintech organizations, product management roles

---

## Executive Summary

Your portfolio demonstrates a strong foundation with modern design, real-world case studies, and honest positioning. However, to maximize its job-hunting potential, we need to focus on **storytelling clarity**, **impact quantification**, **technical credibility**, and **user engagement optimization**.

### Current Strengths
✓ Professional design with responsive layout  
✓ Real case studies from TransferMate (fintech product)  
✓ Comprehensive skill matrix  
✓ Clear professional narrative  
✓ Mobile-responsive pages  

### Critical Gaps to Address
⚠ Weak impact metrics in project descriptions (no "results")  
⚠ Underutilized case study pages (missing context, process, learnings)  
⚠ Limited technical depth for developer/technical PM roles  
⚠ Generic placeholder content on secondary pages  
⚠ No explicit problem-solution-outcome framework  
⚠ Missing evidence of collaborative impact & team leadership

```

### Assessment by Page

#### ✅ index.html - **GOOD** (Core Hub)
**Current State:** Professional main page with all major sections  
**What Works:**
- Clean sidebar navigation
- Clear role statement: "Product Owner, Entrepreneur & UI/UX Designer"
- Organized sections: About → Skills → Experience → Education → Projects → Contact
- 6 years of experience timeline shown
- Soft skills emphasized (lean, UX, product management, etc.)

**Gaps to Fill:**
- About section lacks a compelling opening hook ("Why hire Zlatomir?")
- Professional statement is too generic/template-like
- No metrics on accomplishments (users impacted, revenue growth, etc.)
- Experience section needs quantified impact
- Skills section needs proficiency levels or context
- No visible "featured projects" on homepage

---

#### 🟡 tm-redesign.html - **NEEDS EXPANSION** (Most Important Case Study)
**Current State:** Good foundational structure, but incomplete storytelling  

**What's There:**
- Project title: "Payment Separations"
- Problem statement (payment UX was confusing/cluttered)
- Business model explanation
- User alignment & client feedback sections
- Exception handling & client alignment subsections

**Critical Missing Elements:**

1. **Hero/Context Section** - Need upfront:
   - What is TransferMate? (2-3 sentence explanation)
   - Timeline (When did you work on this? Duration?)
   - Your role explicitly stated (Product Owner → lead what? Design? Strategy?)
   - Team composition (How many people? Cross-functional?)

2. **Challenge/Problem Deep-Dive** - Expand:
   - What specific metrics showed the problem? (User drop-off rates? Support tickets?)
   - Who were the stakeholders? (Clients, users, internal team?)
   - What was attempted before? (Why did it fail?)

3. **Solution Narrative** - Currently missing:
   - Design process (Discovery → Design → Testing)
   - Key design decisions and WHY (Not just what changed)
   - User research findings (What did you learn from users?)
   - Wireframes or design thinking process shown

4. **Impact/Results Section** - CRITICAL MISSING:
   - Quantified outcomes:
     - Did user satisfaction improve? By how much? (NPS score? Surveys?)
     - Did adoption increase? By %?
     - Did payment success rate improve? By %?
     - Did support tickets decrease? By %?
     - Was revenue impacted? (Direct or indirect)
   - Timeline to launch/implementation
   - Post-launch learnings

5. **Your Role Specificity** - Need clarity:
   - Did you drive the strategy?
   - Did you lead the design?
   - Did you manage the product roadmap?
   - What was your day-to-day impact?
   - How did you handle stakeholder management?

6. **Learnings & Reflection** - Add:
   - What would you do differently?
   - What surprised you?
   - How did this shape your approach as a PM?
   - One key lesson from this project

**Recommendation:** This is your **strongest asset**. Expand from 1500 words to 2500+ words with quantified results and clear role articulation.

#### 🔴 data-deletion.html - **NEEDS MAJOR DEVELOPMENT** (GDPR/Privacy)
**Current State:** Mostly placeholder content  

**What's There:**
- Title and basic description
- Mentions "bi-annual project"
- Privacy/compliance focus

**What Needs to be Built:**

1. **Project Overview:**
   - GDPR compliance requirement context
   - Business driver (Legal? Customer trust? Regulatory?)
   - Scale of data (How many users? How much data?)

2. **Your Contribution:**
   - Did you lead the initiative?
   - Did you design the technical strategy?
   - Did you manage stakeholders?
   - Cross-functional coordination (Legal, Engineering, Product)

3. **Process & Execution:**
   - How did you identify eligible data?
   - Data mapping & classification approach
   - Automation vs. manual work split
   - Timeline and milestones

4. **Challenges & Solutions:**
   - What complications arose?
   - How did you handle data privacy/security during deletion?
   - International compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

5. **Impact & Outcomes:**
   - Data volume deleted
   - Cost savings (if any)
   - Legal risk reduction
   - Time to compliance

**Recommendation:** This demonstrates **compliance & process management** skills. Strong for regulated industry roles (fintech, healthtech, etc.).

---

#### 🟡 all-projects.html - **NEEDS CONTENT** (Project Hub)
**Current State:** Template structure exists  

**What's Missing:**
- Project grid/listings
- Filter options (by category: Design, Product, Technical)
- Project card design (image, title, role, outcome)
- Link to individual project pages

**Recommendation:** Make this a visual **project gallery** with 4-6 project tiles (real or case studies).

---

#### 🔴 knowledge-base.html - **PLACEHOLDER** (API/Documentation)
**Current State:** Minimal content  

**Decision Point:**
- Is this a real project you want to showcase? If yes → Develop it
- Is this aspirational? If yes → Either remove or make it a blog post
- If it's technical documentation → Add what documentation you created

**Recommendation:** Either develop this fully or convert to a blog post showing your technical communication skills.

---

#### 🟡 partnerships.html - **NEEDS CURATION** (Companies/Collaborations)
**Current State:** Logo grid of companies (TransferMate, GeoSwift, INSEAD, TouchNet, dLocal, eBix)  

**What's Needed:**
- Context for each partnership
- Your specific role/contribution
- Outcomes of collaboration
- What you learned

**Alternative Approach:**
- Combine into "Featured Clients & Collaborations" section on main page
- Add 2-3 sentence description per company showing your impact

---

#### 🟡 certification.html - **NEEDS DEVELOPMENT** (Credentials)
**Current State:** Minimal content  

**What to Add:**
- List of certifications with issuer, date, credential link
- Relevant courses or trainings
- Industry memberships
- Thought leadership (speaking, writing, Open Source)

**Recommendation:** This is **lower priority** unless you have strong certifications. If light on certs, integrate into main About section instead.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

Your portfolio is **above average** but has untapped potential. The key gaps are:

1. **Quantification** - Add numbers everywhere (% improvements, user counts, etc.)
2. **Storytelling** - Make each project a compelling narrative, not just a description
3. **Role Clarity** - Be explicit about what YOU owned vs. team contributions
4. **Impact Evidence** - Always show results/outcomes, not just effort

**The Golden Rule for Hiring Managers:**
> "I don't care that you worked on payment redesign.  
> I care that you **improved completion rates by 23%** and **cut support tickets by 40%**."

Focus on this, and you'll dramatically improve your job search success.

## Appendix B: Example Rewrite (Before/After)

### BEFORE (Current TransferMate Content)

> "This project aimed to re-work the existing TransferMate Education [Links / Web Solution] with an up to date design and user experience that creates delight and ease of use for the millions of users across the globe. Previously, the design language, user experience and overall structure of the links which TM provided for each client was really bad and was full of clutter, which created confusion and was rough to navigate in general."

### AFTER (Optimized Version)

> **The Challenge:** TransferMate's payment links served millions of global transactions monthly, but they suffered from a cluttered interface that confused users and overwhelmed support teams. We identified:
> - 28% of users abandoned the payment flow before completion
> - Support tickets for "How do I pay?" increased 3x in Q3
> - Mobile users had a 40% lower completion rate than desktop
>
> **My Approach:** As Product Owner leading design and engineering, I championed a "user-first redesign" that:
> 1. Conducted user research with 50+ actual users to understand pain points
> 2. Simplified the 7-step flow to 3 essential steps
> 3. Implemented progressive disclosure (show only what's needed)
> 4. Optimized for mobile-first experience
>
> **Results:**
> - Payment completion rate: 72% → 89% (+24% improvement)
> - Support tickets: 450/month → 180/month (-60% reduction)
> - Mobile completion rate: 55% → 82% (+49% improvement)
> - Time-to-payment: 4.2 minutes → 1.8 minutes (-57% faster)
> - User satisfaction NPS: +18 point improvement
>
> **What I Learned:** User research is non-negotiable. The solutions we assumed users wanted (more features!) were wrong. What they actually needed was clarity and speed. This shaped my entire approach to product discovery going forward.
