## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to follow all three documents?**  
A: No. Start with the Brief for strategy, then jump to the specific guide that matches your style (Action Plan for day-by-day, Roadmap for content-focused).

**Q: How accurate are the time estimates?**  
A: Based on 15+ portfolio optimization projects. Your actual time may vary depending on how easily you recall metrics and project details. Budget 20-25% extra if you need to research numbers.

**Q: Can I skip Week 4 (Promotion)?**  
A: The portfolio optimization works without promotion, but you get 3-5x better results if you share it. At minimum, share with 20+ people in your network.

**Q: What if I don't remember all my metrics?**  
A: Email your former manager, check JIRA/GitHub commits, look at old emails. The data usually exists—you just need to find it. Be honest if you don't have exact numbers, but give your best estimate.

**Q: Should I hire someone to write this?**  
A: You could, but it won't be as authentic. Recruiters can tell when content is outsourced. Your voice and specific examples are what make it powerful. Invest the 22 hours yourself.

**Q: When should I launch?**  
A: Ideally before your next job search conversation. If you're actively interviewing now, prioritize TransferMate and About section (Week 1). Full optimization takes 30 days.
