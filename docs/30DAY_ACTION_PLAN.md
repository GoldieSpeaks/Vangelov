## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Tip 1: Batch Similar Work
Don't jump between projects. Do all writing on Monday-Tuesday, all editing on Wednesday-Thursday, deployment on Friday.

### Tip 2: Write First, Optimize Second
Get the content out first. Polish later. Perfectionism is the enemy of progress.

### Tip 3: Use Your Own Data
Make phone calls to your old manager, check email, look at JIRA tickets. The numbers are there—you just need to find them.

### Tip 4: Ask for Help
If you can't remember a metric, email your former manager or colleague: "Hey, do you remember what the payment completion rate improvement was?" Most people are happy to help.

### Tip 5: Make It Shareable
After you finish, send your portfolio to 20+ people. Each share is a chance for a lead.
